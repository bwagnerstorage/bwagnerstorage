### This is a storage account that contains the original and new version of the BWagner website

In the 2022-2023 school year, a computer science teacher retired named B. Wagner. He had owned the domain name BWagner.org and a website with the tab name "comp sci". Timothy Stuart and Jackson Sacharko (note: I, Jackson, really hate writing this and then referring to myself in the 3rd person knowing Timmy might get on and write something here) were freshman students that year and although they had barely known both they loved the subject and its teacher. The goal of moving the BWagner site to github is to allow Mr. Wagner to not have to spend unnecessary money in retirement and to preserve the site. What we were told at the end of the year is that the original site would stay up for 2 more years, the truth of that is not certain. (I, Jackson, as of writing this in the 2023 summer, the site is still up and running.)


Some important notes:
1. The original website cannot be hosted on github because of the limitation of no server-side languages such as PHP which the site uses heavily. This is why we have made a new version with workarounds so no PHP is needed.
2. The bwagnerstorage@gmail.com account is owned currently by 3 people: Jackson Sacharko, Timothy Stuart, and Mr. Wagner.
3. The new site takes nearly 15 minutes to update after a site change which is long for us.
